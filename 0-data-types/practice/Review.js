// 1. What do you run in terminal to check your work?
        //console.log your work first
//      type "node" then file = by hitting tab after the first few 
//      correct letters it will auto generate the correct response or give an error code

// 2. Using JavaScript, find the data type of 50
        console.log(typeof 50);
// 3. Using JavaScript, find the data type of 'hello world'
        console.log(typeof 'hello world';)

// 4. What types of data are non-primitive and why?

        // Primitive types of data include, strings, numbers, boolean
        // null, undefined, symbol,bigInt, 
        // Non-primitive types of data include objects and functions 

        //the biggest difference between primative and non-primitive being 
        //primitives are immutable and non-primitives are mutable

// 5. Log the result of 5 + 5 to the terminal
        console.log(5+5)

// 6. What are the only boolean values?
        // The only boolean values there are would be "true" and "false"

// 7. Log a BigInt number
console.log(100n)

// BONUS: Create a variable for each of the data types 
// 8. What is a variable?
       // something that we can declare, and store some value inside of it
       // we can reuse that value going forward in our code
       // const = stays the same and can't be reassigned, and let can be reassigned 
     
// 9. What is a function? 
        // reusbale block of code/logic to do a certain task 
        // methods are functions that are attached to an objects i.e (math.)

// 10. Name two words that the terminal recognizes as numbers
        //Infinity and NaN (Not A Number)

// BONUS: Create a variable for each of the data types 
const string = "hello friends"
const number = 5
const math = Math.random
const boolean = true
const nothing = null 
const nothing1 = undefined
const largenum = 123n
const symbol = symbol("test")
const object = {}
const arr = []
const functin = ()=> {}
